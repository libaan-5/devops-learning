# 02‑application-load-balancer‑setup

Goal: Deploy two EC2 instances behind an ALB. The ALB must handle all incoming traffic. EC2 instances should not be accessible directly from the internet.

Steps:

## 1) Launch two EC2 instances in the same VPC

- Use different availability zones where possible

- Install a simple web server using user-data

- Each instance should return different content for testing

## 2) Create an ALB in two public subnets

- Add HTTP (port 80) listener

- Create a Target Group

- Register both EC2 instances

- Configure a health check on the root path /

## 3. Security Groups

- ALB SG: allow HTTP from anywhere

- EC2 SG: allow HTTP only from the ALB SG

- Do not allow direct public access to EC2

## 4. Testing

- Visit the ALB DNS name

- Refresh to verify traffic alternates between both instances

- Confirm health checks are healthy

## Bonus (Optional)

- Add a Route53 DNS name and point it to the ALB DNS name via ALIAS record type. 

- Add an HTTPS listener with ACM

- Add an Auto Scaling Group behind the ALB

- Keep screenshots and notes for your repo.
